# WARFARE (CTI) by WASP community of ARMA games
Warfare mode for Arma 2/3 was a main reason of WASP community creation. Starting from 2010 WASP
members were trying to improve all in-game aspects. Being one of co-founders I can finally
say: our work has been completed.

Arma 3 became last platform where everyone can try our final vision of CTI mode.
Main differences comparing to old school Arma 2 warfare CTI mode are:
- 3 playable sides: opfor, blufor, resistance
- reworked all UIs
- new AI commander
- new high command module to control dozens of infantry units/vehicles
- optimized for large scale battles
- new chemical arsenal
- new variety of capturable locations with unique perks and features
- new destructible mechanic of towns
- new secondary missions
- new coop playing in one team group
- integrated support of ext3db
- new naval vessels
- new UAV mechanics
- new role system with unique skills and perks
- new intro mission with short in-game tips 
- reworked artillery mechanic with re-worked arty computer and CRAM mechanic

## Project structure
Since all missions must be played in multiplayer mode, the project is designed to be used
on a dedicated server. However, a server requires one headless client to be connected.
It allows reducing server load significantly.

Besides, a separate project was created to support bunch of vanilla and custom maps including:
Altis, Stratis, Malden, Tanoa, Livonia, Cherno, Takistan, Utes, Zargabad, Sahrani, Napf

Last but not least fact all sources are designed to be used with CUP content. Vanilla, RHS or other content related mod
can be added by modifying of configs in a separate project (link can be found below)
