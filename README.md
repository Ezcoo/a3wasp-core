# WARFARE (CTI) by WASP community of ARMA games
Warfare mode for Arma 2/3 was a main reason of WASP community creation. Starting from 2010 WASP
members were trying to improve all in-game aspects. Being one of co-founders I can finally
say: our work has been completed.

Arma 3 became last platform where everyone can try our final vision of CTI mode. </br>
**Main differences** comparing to old school Arma 2 warfare CTI mode are:
- 3 playable sides: opfor, blufor, resistance
- reworked all UIs
- new AI commander
- new high command module to control dozens of infantry units/vehicles
- optimized for large scale battles
- new chemical arsenal
- new variety of capturable locations with unique perks and features
- new destructible mechanic of towns
- new secondary missions
- new coop playing in one team group
- integrated support of ext3db
- new naval vessels
- new UAV mechanics
- new role system with unique skills and perks
- new intro mission with short in-game tips 
- reworked artillery mechanic with re-worked arty computer and CRAM mechanic

## Project structure
Since all missions must be played in multiplayer mode, the project is designed to be used
on a dedicated server. However, a server requires one headless client to be connected.
It allows reducing server load significantly.

Besides, a separate project was created to support bunch of vanilla and custom maps including:
_Altis, Stratis, Malden, Tanoa, Livonia, Cherno, Takistan, Utes, Zargabad, Sahrani, Napf_

Last but not the least fact all sources are **designed to be used with CUP** content. Vanilla, RHS or other content related mod
can be added by modifying of configs in a separate project (link can be found below).

## Assembling
To run missions on your server you must prepare 3 main components:
1) missions themselves
2) server mod
3) **h**eadless **c**lient mod
